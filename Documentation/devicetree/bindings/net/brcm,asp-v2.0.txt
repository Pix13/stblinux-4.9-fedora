Broadcom ASP 2.0 Ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of:
	"brcm,bcm72165-asp-v2.0"
	"brcm,asp-v2.0"

- reg: base address and length of the register set for the entire ASP block
- interrupts: first interrupt specifier should be the main interrupt that
  connects the ASP block. Second and third interrupt specifiers are optional
  and denote the per-port Wake-on-LAN side band interrupts.
- #address-cells: must be 1
- #size-cells: must be 0

Optional properties:
- clocks: When provided must be a single phandle to the clock controller
  followed by the unique number for the ASP clocks
- clock-names: When provided the names of the function clock must be "sw_asp"
- brcm,reserved-net-filters-mask: When provided the network filter correlated
  with the bitmap will not be used by the driver.

Required child nodes:

- ethernet-ports: container node describing the Ethernet port(s) within the
  ASP block

- mdio bus node: this node should always be present regarless of the PHY
  configuration of the ASP Ethernet port(s)

MDIO bus node required properties:

- compatible: must be "brcm,asp-v2.0-mdio"
- reg: address and length relative to the parent node base register address
- #address-cells: address cell for MDIO bus addressing, should be 1
- #size-cells: size of the cells for MDIO bus addressing, should be 0

Ethernet ports subnode required properties:

- reg: numeric identifier for the port number
- channel: ASP channel number for the Ethernet port
- phy-mode: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory

Ethernet ports subnode optional properties:

- phy-handle: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory; used to describe
  configurations where a PHY (internal or external) is used.

- fixed-link: When the ASP Ethernet port interface is connected to a MoCA
  hardware block or when operating in a RGMII to RGMII type of connection, or
  when the MDIO bus is voluntarily disabled, this property should be used to
  describe the "fixed link".  See
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/fixed-link.txt for information on the
  property specifics

Example:

asp@9c00000 {
	compatible = "brcm,asp-v2.0";
	reg = <0x9c00000 0x101010>;
	interrupts = <0 51 4>;
	ranges;
	clocks = <&scmi 14>;
	brcm,reserved-net-filters-mask = <0xff>;

	mdio@c614 {
		compatible = "brcm,asp-v2.0-mdio";
		reg = <0xc614 0x8>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		phy0: ethernet-phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
		};
	};

	mdio@ce14 {
		compatible = "brcm,asp-v2.0-mdio";
		reg = <0xce14 0x8>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		phy1: ethernet-phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
		};
	}

	ethernet-ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			channel = <8>;
			phy-mode  "rgmii";
			phy-handle = <&phy0>;
		};

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			channel = <9>;
			phy-mode  "rgmii";
			phy-handle = <&phy1>;
		};
	};
};
